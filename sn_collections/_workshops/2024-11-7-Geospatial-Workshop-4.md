In this tutorial you will learn the basic concepts of the Python library `xarray` while exploring its capabilities when working with multidimensional datasets with dimensions of time, latitude, and longitude. We will also touch on the capabilities of parallel processing using another Python library called `dask`. 

Additional details and instructions for the tutorial will be added closer to the event. A recording of the tutorial will be added after the workshop concludes.
