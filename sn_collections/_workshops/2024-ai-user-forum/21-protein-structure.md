In this workshop, participants will learn how to use cutting-edge, AI-based tools for analyzing protein structure and function. <!--excerpt-->  

The workshop will start by exploring 3D protein structure prediction using AlphaFold for alignment-based structure prediction and ESMFold for single-sequence structure prediction. Participants will then learn how to use FoldSeek for structure-based protein similarity search. The last part of the workshop will bring all of these concepts together by using PanEffect to explore how genetic variations in protein sequence can influence an organism’s phenotype.
