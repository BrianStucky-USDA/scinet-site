In this workshop, participants will explore techniques for evaluating the accuracy and completeness of genome assemblies and annotations, helping attendees understand key metrics and statistical methods used to assess the quality of genomic data. <!--excerpt--> 

Knowing how to evaluate a genome will ensure reliable results for downstream, AI-based analyses like gene model prediction, variant detection, or comparative studies. Participants will also learn how to extract the transcripts and proteins from their genomes, to enable a variety of downstream AI-based applications, such as protein structure prediction. By the end of the workshop, attendees will be better equipped with the practical skills necessary to evaluate genomes and annotations for a range of bioinformatics applications.
