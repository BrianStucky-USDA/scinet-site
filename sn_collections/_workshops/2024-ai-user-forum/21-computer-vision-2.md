title: "Computer vision II: object detection and semantic segmentation"
date: 2024-11-21 12:30
categories: [2024 AI User Forum] 
time: 1:30-4:30pm CT
lead: ARS SCINet Office

section: November 21, Afternoon — Applications of AI

prerequisites:
  - text: Familiarity with basic machine learning concepts. The workshop on November 20 will provide this background, if needed.
  - text: Familiarity with basic computer vision concepts (e.g., an understanding of how image data are structured in computer memory). The morning computer vision workshop will provide this background.
  - text: Familiarity with basic Python concepts and Jupyter notebooks. We will offer virtual training for these skills before the Forum begins.

In this workshop, participants will learn the key concepts and techniques needed to use modern, deep learning-based computer vision methods for object detection and semantic segmentation. Learners will practice training and evaluating state-of-the-art computer vision models on custom image datasets. 

This workshop is intended as a continuation of “Computer vision I: introduction and image classification”, but participants do not need to take the earlier workshop if they already have a basic knowledge of machine learning and computer vision concepts.<!--excerpt-->
