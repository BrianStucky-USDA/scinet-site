This tutorial will illustrate a workflow using a Graph Convolutional Neural Network with LSTM layers (GLSTM model) to classify West Nile Virus disease presence or absence in horses across counties in a subset of states in the US.  

Additional details and instructions for the tutorial will be added closer to the event. A recording of the tutorial will be added after the workshop concludes.
