title: "Tutorial: Species distribution modeling with MaxEnt"
description: Provides hands-on tutorials on workflows to access the SCINet HPC systems and conduct geospatial research at scale and fosters geospatial research efforts.
excerpt: "During this session, we will explore the topic of species distribution / environmental niche modeling (SDM/ENM), with a particular focus on MaxEnt (maximum entropy), a popular SDM/ENM algorithm used to estimate species habitats from presence-only occurrence records. You will have an opportunity to put the concepts you’ve learned into practice by creating a species range map from real-world data in a hands-on MaxEnt workflow tutorial. "

During this session, we will explore the topic of species distribution / environmental niche modeling (SDM/ENM), with a particular focus on MaxEnt (maximum entropy), a popular SDM/ENM algorithm used to estimate species habitats from presence-only occurrence records. You will have an opportunity to put the concepts you’ve learned into practice by creating a species range map from real-world data in a hands-on MaxEnt workflow tutorial. 

Additional details and instructions for the tutorial will be added closer to the event. A recording of the tutorial will be added after the workshop concludes.
