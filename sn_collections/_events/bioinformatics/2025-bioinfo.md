If you are interested in learning a complete story, we recommend registering for all workshops in this series. However, it is not required, and you may register for only the workshops that are most relevant to your work. 

You will need a SCINet account to actively participate in this workshop. [If you do not have a SCINet account, you may request one](https://scinet.usda.gov/about/signup).

## Pre-Workshop Instructions: 
To help minimize technical issues and delays at the start of the workshop, please try the following tests prior to the workshop. 

1. Logging on to Ceres Open OnDemand (OOD): Please confirm you can successfully log in to Ceres OOD with your SCINet account (see instructions here). If you are successful, you will be able to see the Ceres OOD home page.   
1. Ceres Shell Access: When on Ceres OOD, click on the top navigation bar: “Clusters” > “Ceres Shell Access”. A new tab will appear that looks like a shell terminal (e.g., like PowerShell). Please confirm you do not receive any error messages or requests to re-authenticate and that the final line looks like “[firstname.lastname@ceres ~]$”.  
1. RStudio Server: Back on the main Ceres OOD tab, click on the top or side navigation bar: “Interactive Apps” > “RStudio Server”.  
  * Fill the input fields with the following (input fields not listed below can be left at their default values):
    * account: scinet_workshop2
    * Number of hours: 1
    * Number of cores: 1
    * Memory: 16GB
    * Additional Slurm Parameters: (leave empty)
  * Click the “Launch” button.
  * Wait a moment for the job card to update from “Queued” to “Running”.
  * Please confirm that clicking on the “Connect to RStudio Server” button opens a new tab with the RStudio Server interface.
