This SCINet working group aims to explore the potential benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in animal behavior research. The working group will provide an open platform where participants can share knowledge, discuss challenges, and explore opportunities for leveraging high-performance computing resources through SCINet to advance animal behavior research.<!--excerpt--> By leveraging cutting-edge AI techniques, we aim to tackle the potential limitations of traditional methods, including challenges with handling large datasets and the computational demands of advanced analyses.
