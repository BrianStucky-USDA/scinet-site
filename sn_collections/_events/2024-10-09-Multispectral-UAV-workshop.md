This workshop will focus on processing multispectral imagery from unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) and extracting zonal statistics for geospatial modeling using OpenDroneMap on SCINet systems. <!--excerpt--> Participants will be introduced to the different stages of processing multispectral imagery collected using UAVs, and the development of tools for the extraction of zonal statistics in a format that can be directly used in geospatial modeling will be shared. Topics covered in the workshop will include:

* Installation and set up of the miniconda environment
* Pre-processing: Tools to filter out redundant imagery by altitude and location
* Pre-processing: Conversion of multispectral imagery digital numbers to reflectance
* Processing: OpenDroneMap to generate multispectral orthophotos
* Tools to generate vegetation indices from multispectral imagery, volume estimates from digital surface models, and extraction of zonal statistics

**Prerequisites:** Workshop participants should have some familiarity with Python, using the command line, and basic knowledge about remote sensing and geospatial concepts.
