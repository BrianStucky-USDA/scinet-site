On November 6-7, 2024, the SCINet Geospatial Research Working Group (GRWG) will be hosting their 2024 Annual Workshop. The workshop is split over two half-days that will have sessions including:

* Lightning talks on geospatial analyses and workflows that use SCINet resources
* Hands-on tutorials that cover a variety of topics:
  * Applying computational methods such as environmental niche modeling and graph convolutional neural networks
  * Using Python packages for multidimensional arrays to process geospatial data
  * Migrating your workflow to SCINet
* Discussions on GRWG activities for the new year, including desired training topics and collaboration opportunities.


## Workshop Goals

The two overarching goals of the GRWG Annual Workshop are to:

1. Provide hands-on tutorials on workflows to access the SCINet high-performance computing (HPC) systems and conduct geospatial research at scale.
1. Foster research efforts that had previously been unattainable due to computational limitations or technical bottlenecks.

# How to Participate
{:.border-bottom}

To participate in the workshop, please register by submitting [the registration form](https://forms.office.com/g/XqvSkCMeM2). A calendar event with the Zoom call-in information will be sent after you register. 

The form asks for your SCINet account since full participation in hands-on activites will require an account. **If you do not have a SCINet account already, [please apply for one]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/signup).** We recommend applying for an account as soon as possible, as the process can take time for final approval. All registrants will be invited to a pre-workshop support session the week before the workshop to test logging into their SCINet account.
