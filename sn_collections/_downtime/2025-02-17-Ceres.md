Ceres cluster maintenance is scheduled for February 17-18, 2025 (Presidents Day and the following day).

During the maintenance, in addition to regular tasks, the VRSC will replace the clusterâ€™s virtualization infrastructure (this will NOT affect how users interact with Ceres). The old storage hardware will be dismantled.

Queued jobs will not start if they cannot complete by 6 AM CT on February 17. In the output of the squeue command, the reason for those jobs not yet starting will state (ReqNodeNotAvail, Reserved for maintenance). The jobs will start after the scheduled outage completes.

The Atlas cluster will be available during the Ceres maintenance. Make sure to copy data from Ceres to Atlas or Juno prior to the maintenance, if needed.
