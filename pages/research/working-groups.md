The SCINet initiative contributes funding to various working groups that use SCINet computational resources for research. The funding is generally used to convene in-person group workshops. There are also two working groups that develop SCINet learning/training materials.

## Creating a working group

If you are interested in creating a working group, please compile the following:
* The Working Group's name
* A description of the Working Group including purpose and goals
* Contact information for people who want to join

Send this information to the SCINet office at [ARS-SCINet-Office@usda.gov](mailto:ARS-SCINet-Office@usda.gov).
